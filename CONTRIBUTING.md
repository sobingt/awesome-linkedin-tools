## Guidelines

### For Tool Descriptions

✅ **Good**:
- "Cloud-based LinkedIn outreach with AI-powered personalization"
- "Multi-account automation with sequence builder and safety throttling"

❌ **Avoid**:
- Marketing speak: "The #1 LinkedIn automation tool"
- Vague: "Helps with LinkedIn"
- Superlatives: "Best", "Easiest", "Most Powerful"

### Categorization

Tools may fit multiple categories. Use the **primary** purpose:
- A tool that does enrichment + outreach → List in **Outreach** if outreach is primary
- A tool that syncs LinkedIn to CRM → List in **Multichannel**

### Tags Usage

Use tags consistently:
- `outreach` - LinkedIn messaging/connection automation
- `task-automation` - Profile visits, follow/unfollow, tagging
- `scraping` - Data extraction from LinkedIn
- `enrichment` - Email finding, contact data
- `cloud` - Cloud-based SaaS
- `extension` - Browser extension
- `automation` - Scriptable automation
- `framework` - Automation framework/library
- `integration` - Integrates with CRM/ATS
- `crm` - Customer Relationship Management platform
- `ai` - Uses AI/Machine Learning

### Risk Levels

- **Low**: Established tools, low ban risk, transparent operations
- **Medium**: Newer tools, some LinkedIn policy uncertainty, uses automation
- **High**: Raw scraping, headless browsers, high ban/account risk

### Keep It Neutral

- No affiliate links without disclosure
- No promotional language
- Link to **official homepages** only (not landing pages)
- Disclose if you're the tool creator/maintainer
